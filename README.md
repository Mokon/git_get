# git_get
git_get is a perl script which produces statistics about a git repository

If you run in this script from any git repository directory it will output
statistics about the repository to stdout. Optionally you can include a
configuration file in the directory where you execute the script or in your home
directory. An example configuration file can be seen in the file git_get.cfg.
You must use that name for your configuration file.
